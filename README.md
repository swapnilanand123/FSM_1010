# FSM_1010

A sequence detector, particularly a Mealy state machine, is a digital circuit that is designed to recognize a specific sequence of inputs and produce an output accordingly. In your case, you want to understand how a Mealy state machine would function as a "sequence_detector_overlapping" for the input sequence "1010". Let's break down how this would work step by step.

1. Input and Output:
   - Input: The input to the sequence detector is a stream of binary digits (0s and 1s).
   - Output: The sequence detector should produce an output whenever the input sequence "1010" is detected. This output can be in the form of a signal, typically represented as '1' for detected and '0' for not detected.

2. State Transition Diagram:
   To design a Mealy state machine, you need to create a state transition diagram that represents the behavior of the machine. In this case, the machine will have four states because we are looking for the sequence "1010". These states can be labeled as S0, S1, S2, and S3. Each state corresponds to the pattern of the last few input digits processed.

   - S0: Initial state
   - S1: Detected '1' at the first position.
   - S2: Detected '10' at the first and second positions.
   - S3: Detected '1010' as the last four positions.

3. State Transition Table:
   The state transition table specifies the next state and output for each combination of the current state and input. Since this is a Mealy machine, the output depends on both the current state and input.

   ```
   Current State (Q)  |  Input (X)  |  Next State (Q')  |  Output (Z)
   --------------------------------------------------------------
          S0         |     1      |         S1        |       0
          S0         |     0      |         S0        |       0
          S1         |     1      |         S1        |       0
          S1         |     0      |         S2        |       0
          S2         |     1      |         S1        |       0
          S2         |     0      |         S3        |       0
          S3         |     1      |         S1        |       1
          S3         |     0      |         S0        |       0
   ```

   In this table:
   - Current State (Q): Represents the current state of the machine.
   - Input (X): Represents the input bit being processed.
   - Next State (Q'): Specifies the state that the machine transitions to after processing the input bit.
   - Output (Z): Represents the output generated by the machine for the given input and current state.

4. Explanation of State Transitions:
   - Initially, the machine is in state S0.
   - If it receives '1' as input in state S0, it remains in S0 (no sequence detected).
   - If it receives '0' in state S0, it also remains in S0.
   - If it receives '1' in state S1, it transitions to state S1 (no sequence detected).
   - If it receives '0' in state S1, it transitions to state S2.
   - If it receives '1' in state S2, it transitions to state S1.
   - If it receives '0' in state S2, it transitions to state S3.
   - In state S3, if it receives '1', it transitions to state S1 and produces an output '1' (sequence detected).
   - If it receives '0' in state S3, it goes back to S0.

5. Mealy Machine Operation:
   - The Mealy state machine processes input bits one by one and maintains its current state based on the state transition table.
   - The output is generated at each clock cycle, dependent on the current state and input.
   - When the machine is in state S3, it outputs '1' to indicate that the "1010" sequence has been detected.

This Mealy state machine will effectively detect the sequence "1010" in an input stream and provide the output '1' when the sequence is found. It will continue scanning for the next occurrence after detection, as indicated by the state transitions.
